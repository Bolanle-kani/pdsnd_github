### Project Title
Pandas Basic Data Exploration on Bikeshare Data

### Description
A Python project that uses pandas to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

This project focuses on pandas library usage and simple statistical methods to do descriptive analysis on bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City 
to present information such as most popular days or most common stations.

Program Specifics
The application requires user input for the city (e.g., Chicago), month for which data is desired 
(e.g., January; also provides a 'all' option), and day for which data is desired (e.g., Monday; also includes a 'all' option).
After receiving user input, it proceeds to ask the user if they want to examine the raw data 
(5 rows of data at first) or not. Following the input, the application prints the following information:
Most popular month
Most popular day
Most popular hour
Most popular start station
Most popular end station
Most popular combination of start and end stations
Total trip duration
Average trip duration
Types of users by number
Types of users by gender (if available)
The oldest user (if available)
The youngest user (if available)
The most common birth year amongst users (if available)
Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.
